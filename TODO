- Redesign details view controller.
	- Make sure the space is correct between the title and the track name (is it still practical to have the track name in this place?) - Has this been done yet ?
	- Do we wan't to have pictures of the concerned person?


- Fix tracks (new xcal database broke the old tracks as there is no longer a tracks field, have to ask and see if it can be included as <track>)
