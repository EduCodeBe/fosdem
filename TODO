- Events taking place now or in the near future view.
	- Work out a way to find events happening now and coming up and cache them. (NSDictionary containing date and event array, updated if older than 5 minutes or on launch?)
	- TableView with Sections for now, 1 hour away, 2 hours away.

- Redesign details view controller.
	- Make sure the space is correct between the title and the track name (is it still practical to have the track name in this place?) - Has this been done yet ?
	- Do we wan't to have pictures of the concerned person?

- Database caching (would allow us to restore our caches as well)
	- Save caches to plist file with md5 of database checking the database for changes on start.
    
- Starred icon: Contact Byline developer about using the icons!

- Fix tracks (new xcal database broke the old tracks as there is no longer a tracks field, have to ask and see if it can be included as <track>)
